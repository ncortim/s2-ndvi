# s2-ndvi
This repository contains Python code for calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 Level 2A imagery using GDAL. The script reads the Red and Near Infrared (NIR) bands from Sentinel-2 data, computes NDVI, and outputs the result as a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG).
